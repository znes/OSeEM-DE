# OSeEM-DE
## Open Sector-coupled Energy Model for Germany

OSeEM-DE is a tool constructed using Oemof Tabular to apply cross-sectoral approaches for analyzing 100% renewable and sector-coupled energy system in Germany.

To run the scripts, you need to install Oemof Tabular using the following command- 
```
pip install oemof.tabular
```
For details on Oemof Tabular please go through the documentation-
https://oemof-tabular.readthedocs.io/

The model uses Oemof-Solph, a model generator for energy system modelling and optimisation (LP/MILP). The oemof.solph package is part of the Open energy modelling framework (Oemof). This an organisational framework to bundle tools for energy system modelling. Details on Oemof-Solph can be is described here- https://github.com/oemof/oemof-solph
