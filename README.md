# OSeEM-DE
## Open Sector-coupled Energy Model for Germany

OSeEM-DE is a tool constructed using Oemof Tabular to apply cross-sectoral approaches for analyzing 100% renewable and sector-coupled energy system in Germany.

To run the scripts, you need to install Oemof Tabular using the following command- 
```
pip install oemof.tabular
```
For details on Oemof Tabular please go through the documentation-
https://oemof-tabular.readthedocs.io/

The model uses Oemof-Solph, a model generator for energy system modelling and optimisation. The oemof.solph package is part of the Open energy modelling framework (Oemof). This an organisational framework to bundle tools for energy system modelling. Details on Oemof-Solph is described here- https://github.com/oemof/oemof-solph

Abstract: The ambitious energy target to achieve climate-neutrality in the European Union (EU) energy system raises the feasibility question of using only renewables across all energy sectors. As one of the EU’s leading industrialized countries, Germany has adopted several climate-action plans for the realistic implementation and maximum utilization of renewable energies in its energy system. The literature review shows a clear gap in comprehensive techniques describing an open modeling approach for analyzing fully renewable and sector-coupled energy systems. This paper outlines a method for analyzing the 100% renewable-based and sector-coupled energy system’s feasibility in Germany. Based on the open energy modeling framework, an hourly optimization tool ‘OSeEM-DE’ is developed to investigate the German energy system. The model results show that a 100% renewable-based and sector-coupled system for electricity and building heat is feasible in Germany. The investment capacities and component costs depend on the parametric variations of the developed scenarios. The annual investment costs vary between 17.6 and 26.6 bn €/yr for volatile generators and between 23.7 and 28.8 bn €/yr for heat generators. The model suggests an investment of a minimum of 2.7–3.9 bn €/yr for electricity and heat storage. Comparison of OSeEM-DE results with recent studies validates the percentage-wise energy mix composition and the calculated Levelized Cost of Electricity (LCOE) values from the model. Sensitivity analyses indicate that storage and grid expansion maximize the system’s flexibility and decrease the investment cost. The study concludes by showing how the tool can analyze different energy systems in the EU context.
